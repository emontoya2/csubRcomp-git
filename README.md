This document is freely available. There are grammatical errors in the document.  If you do encounter a mistake or an error please inform me so that it can be corrected.

Keep in mind that this document is a work in progress, and the eventual goal is to make this document independent of any class textbook. 

The first two chapters introduce one to the **R** environment and **RStudio** and some basic **R** functions so that one gets an idea of the "``"Look and Feel" of **R** and **RStudio**. The last chapter  discuss how to use **R** to carry out the analyses and techniques for some common areas covered in undergraduate regression analysis.     
 
 The best way to use this document is to apply a learn-by-doing approach. That is, don't just read through the **R** code given, but try the sample code given so that you understand what works and what does not.  Finally, this document is not intended to be a know all guide but only a companion to your course. It is also worth noting that there are several ways to do the same thing in **R** and my hope is that I presented the easiest way(s).
