# Preface {-}


This document is freely available and a work in progress. It may contain grammatical errors, so please report any so they can be corrected.

If you'd like to suggest content additions or edits, feel free to contact me; contributions will be acknowledged in future updates. The goal is to eventually make this resource independent of any specific textbook.

The first two chapters introduce the basics of the **R** environment and RStudio, giving you a feel for their interface and core functionality. The final chapter demonstrates how to use **R** for common techniques in undergraduate regression analysis.

This guide is best used with a learn-by-doing approach: run the example code yourself to see how it works. It's not a comprehensive manual, but a course companion. And since there are often multiple ways to do the same task in **R**, I've aimed to present the most accessible methods.
